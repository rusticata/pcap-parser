//! PCAPNG file format
//!
//! See <https://github.com/pcapng/pcapng> for details.
//!
//! There are several ways of parsing a PCAPNG file. The first method is to use
//! [`parse_pcapng`](../fn.parse_pcapng.html). This method requires to load the entire
//! file to memory, and thus may not be good for large files.
//!
//! The second method is to create a [`PcapNGCapture`](../struct.PcapNGCapture.html) object,
//! which  implements the [`Capture`](../trait.Capture.html) trait to provide generic methods.
//! However, this method also reads the entire file.
//!
//! The third (and prefered) method is to use a [`PcapNGReader`](../struct.PcapNGReader.html)
//! object.
//!
//! The last method is to manually read the blocks using
//! [`parse_sectionheaderblock`](fn.parse_sectionheaderblock.html),
//! [`parse_block_le`](fn.parse_block_le.html) and/or
//! [`parse_block_be`](fn.parse_block_be.html).
//!
//! ## File format and parsing
//!
//! A capture file is organized in blocks. Blocks are organized in sections, each section
//! starting with a Section Header Block (SHB), and followed by blocks (interface description,
//! statistics, packets, etc.).
//! A file is usually composed of one section, but can contain multiple sections. When a SHB is
//! encountered, this means a new section starts (and all information about previous section has to
//! be flushed, like interfaces).
//!
//! ## Endianness
//!
//! The endianness of a block is indicated by the Section Header Block that started the section
//! containing this block. Since a file can contain several sections, a single file can contain
//! both endianness variants.
